# Machine Learning in Aplication

The unprecedented explosion of ICT and Artificial Intelligence technologies is driving a revolution that is transforming many important sectors of our society, including medicine and industry. Nonetheless, real-world applications, especially in such critical domains, often pose unique challenges and issues that need to be addressed.

This course aims to fill the gap between ideal and real and to provide a hands-on experience of the latest solutions and domain-specific applications of ML and DL in biology and industry. In the end, students will learn how to apply the ML and DL models they have studied to real-world applications, how to adapt and extend such models to address domain-specific issues and how to design and build ML and DL applications that are usable, useful, and used.
